"""Limit requests to the /api/v1/ routes: at most N per client per minute, then 429.

Counting uses fixed one-minute windows kept in this process's memory: every
counter is cleared when a new minute starts, so memory stays bounded. While a
minute lasts, at most `max_clients` addresses are tracked; requests from new
addresses beyond that are refused too, which protects the process from floods
of fake addresses.

What it protects and what it does not:
    * it caps the database work a client can ask for, which is what matters for
      a free database with a small connection limit;
    * it is per process: several replicas would each have their own counters;
    * the client is the address of the TCP connection. Behind a host's proxy
      (Render, for instance) that is the proxy, so the limit then works as a
      ceiling for the whole API. Trusting forwarded headers is only safe when
      the proxy is the only way in; that choice is made at deploy time (phase 8).

/health, /docs and /openapi.json are not limited, so health checks keep working.
