"""Reject request bodies above MAX_REQUEST_BODY_BYTES with 413.

Only the assistant receives a body (a short question). Two checks, because a client can
omit or misstate Content-Length:
    * a declared Content-Length above the limit is refused before reading;
    * the bytes actually received are counted, and reading stops as soon as they pass it.

Bodies within the limit are buffered (4 KB by default) and handed on unchanged.
